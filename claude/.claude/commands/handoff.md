# Handoff Command

Document the current session's work progress and context for future continuation.

## Instructions

Create or update the HANDOFF.md file in the project root with the following information:

1. **Session Summary**: Brief overview of what was accomplished this session
2. **Current Branch**: Git branch name and its purpose
3. **Work in Progress**: Any incomplete tasks or ongoing work
4. **Recent Changes**: Summary of files modified, created, or deleted
5. **Build/Test Status**: Current state of builds and tests
6. **Blockers/Issues**: Any problems encountered or pending decisions
7. **Next Steps**: Clear action items for the next session
8. **Context & Notes**: Any additional context that would help resume work

## Process

1. Review the conversation history to identify all work done
2. Check git status and recent commits for changes
3. Note any failing tests or build issues
4. Document any decisions made or trade-offs considered
5. Write everything to HANDOFF.md in a clear, structured format

The goal is to provide enough context so that work can be seamlessly resumed in a new session.
